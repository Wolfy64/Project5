## Customer Brief

Michel Dujardin is the founder of the NAO association (Nos Amis les Oiseaux), bringing together ornithology enthusiasts. He wants to create a participatory application in which individuals could indicate where they have observed birds during their walks.

Participants will take part in a research program to study the effects of climate, urbanization and agriculture on biodiversity.

The main users of the application are individuals and naturalists (professionals) who validate in particular the entries on the application. The latter expressed their interest to be able to make the seizure in the field and open the observations to individuals, thanks to smartphones. Nevertheless, not everyone is equipped with smartphones, this can not be the only input method: a web interface will also be necessary.

The application must allow:

- To search the various bird species in the database (download via the TAXREF database of the National Museum of Natural History, class "Aves")
- Display them on a map (after filter by species)
- To capture an "observation" of a bird in the field, with name, date, GPS coordinates and optional photo.
- Validate the observations of individuals (only with a naturalist account).

Observations made by individuals must be validated by naturalists and then posted to everyone. Each user account belongs to either the "special" group or the "naturalist" group in order to give them different access rights to the application. Naturalists can also make entries, which do not require validation.
